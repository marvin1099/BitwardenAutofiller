# BitwardenAutofiller

This Bitwarden autofill script automates the process of filling in login credentials on desktop applications. It leverages Bitwarden's CLI to retrieve and input usernames, passwords, and 2FA codes into non-browser apps, solving the browser-only limitation of Bitwarden's native autofill feature.
